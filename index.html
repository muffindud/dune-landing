            <p class="movie-story">The story of Dune is set in the far distant future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary fiefdoms are controlled by noble houses that owe allegiance to the Imperial House Corrino. The novel tells the story of young Paul Atreides, heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and scion of House Atreides, as he and his family accept control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the 'spice' melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe. The story explores the multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>
